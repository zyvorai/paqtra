# Executive Summary

Paqtra is a single-binary platform that transforms Kubernetes network operations from reactive firefighting into proactive, intelligent management, with both a TUI and a full web dashboard.

Built in Rust for maximum performance, it combines live eBPF datapath monitoring with eight autonomous intelligence engines that detect problems, generate policies, simulate changes, inject faults, manage canary rollouts, and orchestrate multi-cluster environments. The web dashboard adds 64 pages, 75+ REST/WebSocket API endpoints, a visual rule builder, full policy CRUD, RBAC authorization, security hardening, and real kernel eBPF data views (conntrack, policy maps, IP cache, LB maps, drop analytics) powered by bpftool integration.

**Key Metrics:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tests passing | 961 (0 failures) |
| Lines of Rust | 32,000+ |
| Binary size | 13 MB |
| Modules | 13 |
| Interactive tabs | 13 |
| Web dashboard pages | 64 |
| API endpoints | 75+ |
| CPU overhead | < 1% |
| Memory footprint | 50--100 MB |

# Platform Capabilities

## Live Observability

Paqtra streams Hubble flows in real time with verdict-based coloring. Every packet can be explained with a single keypress, showing why it was forwarded or dropped, which policy matched, and what action to take.

Five observability tabs provide complete visibility:

- **Flows** --- live packet stream with per-packet explanation
- **Connections** --- enriched conntrack data with pod metadata
- **Endpoints** --- auto-discovered Cilium endpoints
- **Policies** --- active CiliumNetworkPolicy visualization
- **Metrics** --- eBPF datapath aggregate statistics

## Intelligence Engines

### Self-Healing (Healer)

Analyzes eBPF drop counters to detect network problems --- policy denials, unreachable backends, MTU issues, DNS failures --- and proposes targeted fixes. Operates in dry-run mode by default.

### AutoPolicy

Learns communication patterns from conntrack data and generates CiliumNetworkPolicy YAML. Each recommendation includes a 7-feature ML confidence score:

| Confidence | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| 90--100% | High confidence | Safe for production |
| 75--89% | Moderate | Test in staging |
| 60--74% | Low | Audit mode |
| < 60% | Insufficient data | Manual review |

Policies can be applied, rolled back, or batch-managed directly from the TUI.

### Root Cause Analysis

Correlates dropped packets with active policies to identify the root cause of connectivity failures. Offers one-click fixes that generate and apply corrective CiliumNetworkPolicy resources.

### Dry-Run Simulator

Test policy changes before production. Seven built-in scenarios (add policy, default deny, block traffic, etc.) with full impact analysis: flows affected, services impacted, and risk level scoring.

### Time-Travel Debugging

Record network flows to disk and replay them with VCR-style controls --- play, pause, step forward/backward, jump to events, adjustable playback speed. Enables post-incident analysis without reproducing the failure.

## Operations Engines

### Chaos Engineering

Controlled fault injection using kernel tc-netem rules, applied and removed via kubectl exec. Seven pre-built experiments:

| Experiment | Parameters | Severity |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Network Partition | 20% packet drop | Medium |
| Latency Spike | 500ms +/- 50ms | Medium |
| DNS Outage | 30% DNS failure | High |
| Connection Reset | 15% connection kill | Medium |
| Bandwidth Limit | 10 Mbps cap | Low |
| Packet Corruption | 5% corruption | High |
| Total Partition | 100% drop | Critical |

**Safety features:** configurable limits (max 50% drop, max 5s latency), circuit breaker for emergency shutdown, automatic cleanup after 5 minutes, confirmation required for all experiments.

### Canary Deployments

Progressive traffic shifting without sidecars, using Cilium's native L7 load balancing:

- Start at 10% canary traffic, increment by 10% per step
- Auto-promote when success rate exceeds 99%
- Auto-rollback when success rate drops below 90%
- Real-time visualization: traffic split bars, health gauges, latency comparison

### Multi-Cluster Autopilot

Cross-cluster orchestration for multi-cloud and hybrid deployments:

- Register clusters with provider, region, and API endpoint metadata
- Health-check all clusters via kubectl (node readiness, pod counts)
- Topology visualization with connected pairs and region grouping
- Policy synchronization across clusters
- Intelligent workload placement recommendations

# Architecture

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|                  Terminal UI (ratatui + crossterm)            |
|  13 interactive tabs, 60 FPS rendering                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Healer | AutoPolicy | RootCause | Simulator | Replay       |
|  Chaos  | Canary     | MultiCluster                         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  eBPF Maps (bpftool)    |  Hubble gRPC |  K8s API (kube)  |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|              Cilium Agent  |  Kernel eBPF datapath            |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Design principles:**

- All async I/O uses tokio::process::Command (no blocking on the event loop)
- Dual data path: EnrichedMapReader for real eBPF data, MockMapReader fallback
- Confirmation workflow for destructive operations
- Engine independence: operations engines (Chaos, Canary, MultiCluster) have no eBPF dependency

# Quality Assurance

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Total tests | 961 passing, 0 failures |
| Compiler warnings | 0 |
| Clippy lints | 0 |

The test suite covers core logic, parsers, engine state machines, cross-module interaction, policy generation, simulation impact analysis, and tab navigation.

# Deployment

## Requirements

| Component | Minimum |
|-----------|---------|
| Kubernetes | 1.25+ |
| Cilium | 1.14+ |
| Rust (build) | 1.75+ |

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zyvorai/paqtra.git
cd paqtra
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/paqtra /usr/local/bin/
```

## First Run

```bash
paqtra                    # Full auto-bootstrap
paqtra --skip-bootstrap   # If Cilium/Hubble already running
paqtra --auto-install     # Non-interactive Cilium install
```

The tool auto-detects the cluster, verifies Cilium, enables Hubble relay, starts port-forwarding, and launches the TUI.

# Roadmap

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| v1.0 | All 8 engines wired to TUI, production-ready core |
| v2.0 (Current) | Web dashboard (64 views, React 19), 75+ REST/WS endpoints, RBAC, visual rule builder, security hardening, real eBPF kernel data views |
| v3.0 | Prometheus exporter, Grafana dashboards, plugin system (WASM), deep learning |
