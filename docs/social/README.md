# Social assets

| File | What it is | Rebuild |
|---|---|---|
| `paqtra-share-card.html` / `.png` | 1200×630 card: the README hero and the website's social preview (`website/docusaurus.config.ts` serves this folder as static files) | `./docs/social/build-social-card.sh` |
| `paqtra-social-card.html` / `.jpg` | 1600×900 (16:9) card for LinkedIn and X: the flow → verdict → drop → investigate → policy story | `./docs/social/build-social-card.sh` |
| `paqtra-vs-packetwolf-card.html` / `.jpg` | 1600×900 comparison of Paqtra (community) and PacketWolf (commercial), with a demo call to action. Only shipped PacketWolf features appear; see [`paqtra-vs-packetwolf.md`](../paqtra-vs-packetwolf.md) | `./docs/social/build-social-card.sh` |

The build needs Google Chrome (set `CHROME=...` to override the path) and macOS `sips` for the JPEG. Nothing is installed.

Claims on the cards are limited to what [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) and
[`cilium-brotherhood.md`](../cilium-brotherhood.md) already say: Paqtra observes, Cilium decides.
The flow example on the 16:9 card is illustrative and labelled as such. When the version on the
share-card footer moves, edit `paqtra-share-card.html` and rebuild.
