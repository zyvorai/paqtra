# Paqtra vs PacketWolf

**Paqtra** is the free, Apache-2.0 community edition. **PacketWolf** is the commercial platform built on the same Cilium-native foundation. Paqtra shows you what your Cilium cluster is doing and why. PacketWolf goes further: it attributes traffic to processes, detects threats, contains them, and operates policy for you.

Both target Kubernetes clusters running Cilium 1.14+ with Hubble enabled. Paqtra is read-only toward the datapath by design (see [cilium-brotherhood.md](cilium-brotherhood.md)). PacketWolf adds custom eBPF probes, an in-cluster operator and enforcement backends.

PacketWolf figures are its own published numbers (Feature Guide), with the capabilities spot-checked against its source tree. Paqtra figures come from this repository.

## What both give you

Paqtra is not a demo. These capabilities exist in both products:

- Live Hubble flows with verdict coloring, service map and topology.
- Packet drop analytics and root-cause analysis with one-click CiliumNetworkPolicy fixes.
- AutoPolicy learning, a visual rule builder, a YAML editor and a dry-run policy simulator.
- A network healer, chaos engineering, canary deployments and flow replay.
- Multi-cluster registration and topology.
- Read-only kernel data views: conntrack, policy maps, IP cache, LB maps.
- Web dashboard, REST API and terminal UI.

## What PacketWolf adds

### 1. Kernel intelligence: past pod-to-pod

Paqtra sees flows between pods and identities. PacketWolf sees the process behind every socket.

- **Process-to-network attribution.** Maps each socket to the process, container and pod that owns it.
- **TCP lifecycle tracking.** SYN, ESTABLISHED, FIN, RST and TIME_WAIT with per-connection timing, to spot stuck, half-open and churning connections.
- **Behavioral fingerprinting.** Per-workload profiles of connection patterns, ports and timing, for drift detection against a workload's own history.
- **Cross-layer correlation.** L3, L4, L7, process and eBPF signals in one incident view.
- **Syscall tracing.** `connect`, `bind`, `accept`, `sendmsg` and `execve` through kprobes and tracepoints (opt-in, needs `CAP_BPF`).
- **God Mode explain.** `netpred explain <service>` fuses kernel, DNS, network and policy state into one root-cause narrative.

### 2. A custom eBPF data plane

Paqtra never attaches programs, on purpose. PacketWolf adds opt-in probes for TCP lifecycle, process mapping, DNS path, drops and TCP anomalies, draining into an event bus. Its `/ebpf-dataplane` view reports which probe phases attached, which failed and which still run in userspace, so an empty panel is never a mystery.

### 3. Threat detection

- **ThreatSense detectors** with confidence, a reason chain and a recommended action.
- **Learned behavioral baselines** using per-workload EWMA and a z-score gate, not fixed thresholds.
- **DGA and NXDOMAIN-storm detection**, and **beaconing detection** by inter-arrival periodicity.
- **ThreatThread and attack graph.** Alerts are correlated into multi-stage attack stories.
- **GeoThreat enrichment** with ASN, country and reputation, with optional MaxMind and threat-intel feeds.
- **ProcessLens and RuntimeGuard.** Tetragon exec events tied to the Hubble flows they opened.

### 4. Policy and Zero Trust, in depth

- **Zero-Trust Pilot.** A guided observe → simulate → approve ratchet toward default-deny, one reviewed step at a time.
- **Policy Insight.** Plain-language explanation of any policy and a least-privilege scorecard.
- **Blast-radius simulation.** Which flows and services a change would affect before it ships.
- **Policy drift scanner and KubePosture.** Intended versus live posture, and a single segmentation score with default-deny gaps and world-egress findings.
- **Guided scope wizard.** Pick a VM, pod, namespace or the whole cluster instead of hand-typing selectors.

### 5. Autonomous response and containment

- **Six containment profiles**: FullIsolation, InternetLock, ExfiltrationLock, InvestigationMode, LateralMovementLock and timed Maintenance. They are enforced through Cilium, nftables or libvirt backends.
- **Detect-to-contain loop.** Each high or critical detection is mapped to a profile with a simulated blast radius and a gated confidence.
- **Gated auto-response** with verification and automatic rollback on failure. It is off until you enable it, and anything not confident or safe queues for approval.
- **Namespace and cluster-wide GuardPolicy**, reconciled by the operator into a real `CiliumNetworkPolicy` or `CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`.
- **Forensic pack and incident story.** IR evidence with a CEF sample and an attack narrative, ready for responders.
- **Durable by design.** The `WorkloadContainment` CRD is the source of truth, so containment survives restarts and control-plane loss.

### 6. Ask Zyra, the network copilot

Ask questions about cluster networking in plain English. In agent mode Zyra investigates with 58 read-only tools in a bounded observe-then-replan loop, routes hard questions to threat, policy, DNS, forensics and containment specialists, and keeps per-conversation memory. Write actions (submit a policy, run a playbook, apply a response) require explicit confirmation. On LLM failure it falls back to a deterministic rule router. LLM and agent modes are off by default.

### 7. Compliance, cost and prediction

- **Compliance Lens** maps live posture to SOC 2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA and Zero Trust controls. Paqtra's audits cover CIS, NIST and SOC 2.
- **CVE posture.** Prioritize the CVEs that are reachable over the wire.
- **Cost-aware egress.** See where bytes leave and where the spend is.
- **Risk trend and forecast.** A 14-day ring buffer projects when risk turns critical and likely next targets.
- **Network SIEM report, digital twin and network score.** An executive report, a snapshot of the network and one trendable health number.

### 8. Platform and enterprise integration

- **Kubernetes operator and CRDs**, built on kube-rs with finalizers, status conditions and leader election, for GitOps-managed network intent.
- **`netpred` CLI**, scriptable end to end.
- **Enterprise identity**: OIDC, SAML and LDAP sign-in, and tenant views. On Paqtra's roadmap, shipping in PacketWolf.
- **SIEM export** and remote-access audit.
- **SASE-adjacent APIs**: ingress and egress security overviews, structured egress-gateway management and Hubble-to-policy drafts.

### 9. Consoles for every kind of workload

- **KubeVirt VMs**: serial console and VNC in the browser, NIC binding control, and VM network context next to pods.
- **In-browser shell** into pods and containers.
- **Non-Kubernetes containers.** A lightweight node agent surfaces podman, docker and containerd containers as first-class workloads.
- **Expose and de-expose ports** on demand, and **block/allow enforcement** per workload (nftables for non-Kubernetes containers).

## Which one should I use?

| Choose **Paqtra** when… | Choose **PacketWolf** when… |
|---|---|
| You run Cilium and want to see flows, drops and policy verdicts | You need to know *which process* opened a connection |
| You are evaluating, learning or running a lab | You are running production workloads that need detection and containment |
| Apache 2.0 and community support are enough | You need vendor support and a commercial license |
| You apply policy yourself, through Cilium | You want the platform to draft, simulate, enforce and roll back for you |
| One team, one cluster, JWT sign-in | SSO, multiple tenants, audit and SIEM requirements |
| Kubernetes pods only | VMs and standalone containers share the network |

## What to expect

Some PacketWolf features are opt-in, and they are documented that way: custom eBPF probes need `CAP_BPF`, L7 detectors such as DGA stay inert until deep inspection is enabled for a workload (so they never false-alarm on L3/L4-only clusters), and the Zyra LLM and agent modes are off until you configure them. High-impact containments are approval-gated by default.
